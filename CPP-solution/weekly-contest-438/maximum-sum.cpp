/* 
ðŸ’¡Approach: Greedy + Max Heap
Step 1: Per-row Greedy Selection
        - For each row, sort its elements in descending order.
        - Pick only the top limits[i] elements (best from that row).
        - This respects the row-level limit.

Step 2: Global Optimization
        - Put all picked elements (from all rows) into a max heap (priority queue).
        - From this heap, extract the top k largest elements.
        - This ensures that globally, the sum is maximized with exactly k picks.

Step 3: Return the sum
        - As you extract from the heap, sum the values.
        - This final value is the maximum possible sum under the constraints.
