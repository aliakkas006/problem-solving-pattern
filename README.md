# 🚀 LeetCode Problem Solving Pattern

Welcome to my curated collection of LeetCode problems, organized by problem-solving **patterns** and **data structures/algorithms**. This repository is part of my journey to master problem solving, competitive programming, sharpen my coding skills, and build a solid foundation in algorithmic problem solving.

## 🧠 Problem Solving Approach

Each problem in this repository is solved with clarity and efficiency, following a specific pattern or technique. Common strategies include:

- 🟢 **Two Pointers**
- 🔵 **Sliding Window**
- 🟣 **Binary Search**
- 🟣 **Array & String**
- 🔵 **Linked list**
- 🟣 **Trees**
- 🟢 **Graphs**
- 🟡 **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- 🟠 **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- 🔴 **Dynamic Programming**
- 🟤 **Greedy Algorithms**
- ⚫ **Backtracking**
- ⚪ **Bit Manipulation**
- 🟩 **Union-Find / Disjoint Set**
- 🟦 **Topological Sorting**
- 🟥 **Trie**
- 🟣 **Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bucket Sort**
- ...and more!
