/* 
ðŸš€ Two-Pointer Technique (Fast & Slow Pointers):
    1. Create a dummy node before the head to handle edge cases (like deleting the first node).
    2. Use two pointers: fast and slow, both starting at dummy.
    3. Move fast ahead by n + 1 steps.
        Now there's a gap of n nodes between fast and slow.
    4. Move both fast and slow one step at a time until fast reaches the end.
    5. Now slow is just before the node we want to remove.
    6. Skip the node:
        slow.next = slow.next.next
    7. Return the list starting from dummy.next.
